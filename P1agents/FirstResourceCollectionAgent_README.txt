Resource Agent

This agent tasks a Peasant with collecting wood or gold, whichever is currently less. Once there is enough resources, it creates a second peasant using the TownHall. The two peasants continue to collect resources until they can build a single Farm, a single Barracks, and then up to 3 Footmen in that order.

The documentation was helpful so far. It was confusing to try and build the farm and barracks at first, because the peasants are tasked with building them instead of the TownHall and in order to complete a compound building action, specific coordinates are needed.
