AstarAgent Implementations

This week we both implemented an A* Search agent for non-dynamic maps. We plan to take the best parts of our implementations and put them together next week in order to make our agent more efficient.


FINAL COMMIT
We decided to go with our first implementation which was working and then created a should replan path method for it.
